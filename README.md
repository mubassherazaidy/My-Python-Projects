# My-Python-Projects
This is a simple Python project I built to practice and share my learning. The main idea is to keep the code clean, easy to understand, and beginner‑friendly. I’ve added error handling so it doesn’t break easily, and the logic is written step by step so anyone new to Python can follow along.
